Tax Calculator

This is a simple web application that calculates tax based on gross annual income, extra income, age group, and total applicable deductions. The tax calculation follows a specific formula, as described below:

If the overall income (after deductions) is under or equal to 8 Lakhs, no tax is applied.
For income over 8 Lakhs, the amount over 8 Lakhs is taxed based on the individual's age group:
30% for people with age less than 40.
40% for people with age between 40 and 60.
10% for people with age greater than or equal to 60.


How to Use

Enter the Gross Annual Income, Extra Income, Age Group, and Total Applicable Deductions in the respective input fields.
Click the "Submit" button.
The application will calculate the tax based on the provided inputs and display the result in a popover.
You can close the popover by clicking the "Close" button.
